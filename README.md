# Orbital chaos

![orbital-chaos](/images/orbital-chaos.png)

This is the repository for the orbital chaos team at the 2021 St Andrews Thinkathon from 27-28 March. 

The topic of our project was *orbital chaos*, where the goal was to explore the stability of different planetary systems computationally. This was done using Python and pygame. 

We tried to make it work in three dimensions, and represented the Doppler shift of planets using colours. Initial velocities are set by dragging and dropping with a mouse, and initial masses are defined by how long the mouse is held down for.

The REVOLVER.py file is written by the three of us. The orbital-chaos.ipynb Python notebook is an implementation of machine learning to determine the stability of orbits written by Joel Beckles.
